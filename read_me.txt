Dear responsible person who reading this,
The reason for writing this txt file is to give you information about the shell script I created to open the project easily. If you are using Linux(because I wrote the code in Linux), you can easily get all the outputs of the file with ./Compile.sh in the terminal.

NOTE: You want to give permission to ./Compile file with sudo chmod +x Compile.sh .This compile file is compiled with g++. It will not work if you are using gcc etc.
